      Throughout history African Americans have been killed, raped, abused, racally profiled, and many more by other races. The movement started in July of 2013 when a teen named Trayvom Martin was shot and killed 17 months earlier
      before the movement started. The movement had been fully recognized for street demonstrations following the deaths of Micheal Brown and Eric Garner in 2014.
      In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 US Presidential Election. The Black Lives Matter movement is a decentralized
      network of activists with no formal heirarchy. Protests for equal rights are still being done to this after the imfamous event of the death of George Floyd.
