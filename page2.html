    <h1>Black Lives Matter History</h1>

      <ul>
  <li>Black Lives Matter was founded around the death of Trayon Martin. Trayon Martin was killed on February 26th 2012 by George Zimmerman.</li>
  <li>African Americans have been innocently murdered, wrongfully convicted, abused, raped for hundred, or even thousands of years.</li>
  <li>Ever since that day in February this is when it manly started an innocent teen was murdered, and he was unarmed.</li>
        <li>Tanisha Anderson was a 37 year old female. The thing is, Tanisha had a Bipolar disorder. A Bipolar disorder is a mental condition marked by alternating periods of elation and depression. Meaning she wasn’t really in a good state at that time. Tanisha was trying to leave the house even though she shouldn't so her family called 911 thinking they could help. Sadly what they didn’t know was that it was going to be Tanisha’s last day alive. So they took Tanisha to a vehicle because the officers believed she needed to go to a mental health facility. What happened was there was some sort of dispute where Tanisha was thrown to the ground by the police officers, handcuffed for about 21 minutes, before the paramedics arrived where she later died.</li>
        <li>10 days after Tanisha Anderson died, Tamir Rice, a 12 year old African American died. </li>
</ul>
